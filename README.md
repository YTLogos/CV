# Requiremwnts

This latest CV template uses luatex engine and need [fontawesome Package version 4.6.3.2.](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/fontawesome) or higher version. This CV template contains fontawesome Package version 4.6.3.2., so you just need install Tex and clone it to your computer.

## on Ubuntu

for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS I did:

```
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex
```

 Note that texlive-full will take a long time to install, maybe few hours. It is possible that you will encount many problems and It will not work well but I just went ahead and did everything. If you encount some errors or warnings, it's Ok, Just Google It.

# How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/YTLogos/CV.git

and then go into the dir CV and change the contents. Final you use Tex 

```
xelatex {your_CV_name}.tex
```

and then you will get the pdf file:{your_CV_name}.pdf!So gook luck!
